# is-project-jp
My IS BookShop project for Intelligent Systems subject on master studies.

This project's purpose is to demonstrate practical usage of NLP and ML tool called DialogFlow through a Chatbot.
In my project, a chatbot is used as a smart assistant in a online book shop.

Besides DialogFlow, the app uses Node.js on server side and React on the client side. 
It also uses MongoDb for a database and is hosted on Heroku.
